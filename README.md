#seloyvu-dock

**seloyvu-dock** is a formal documentation of the SeLoy(vu) language.

if we ever get a three-letter-code for this language then it'll be `sly`.

##why this is in english

well, apparently, according to Hofstadtler's Law, we'll be spending too much time on documenting the language in itself.

by too much time we mean more time than the most time you can think of..
